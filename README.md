# Machine Learning Assignments
This repository contains the assignments that I completed for the NIS-08-04: Machine Learning University Course. The assignments covered Linear Models, Tree Models, and Ensemble Methods.

## Assignment 1: Linear Models
The first assignment introduced me to Python and the fundamental libraries for machine learning. It also gave me a wide understanding of how linear models work. I implemented and tested linear models from scratch.

## Assignment 2: Tree Models
The second assignment gave me an introduction to scikit-learn, a simple but efficient machine learning library in Python. It also gave me a wide understanding of how decision trees work. I learned how to use scikit-learn pipelines and tuned decision tree models with grid search.

## Assignment 3: Ensemble Methods
The third assignment tested my understanding of Ensemble Methods. I learned how to use a voting classifier ensemble using simple models, a stacking classifier using complex models, and ensembles using decision trees.

#### Overall, these assignments gave me hands-on experience with various machine learning algorithms and techniques, and improved my skills in Python programming and scikit-learn library.
